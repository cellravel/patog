# Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Learning Roadmap Puzzle

## Overview

This project is an interactive puzzle game inspired by the vast and intricate roadmap of **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology**. Just as the roadmap is a complex structure where each piece of knowledge builds upon another, this puzzle allows users to engage with the fundamental components of bioinformatics in a playful and interactive way.

## How It Works

- **Puzzle Structure:** Each block within the puzzle represents a category or topic, similar to the sections outlined in the roadmap. These blocks are randomly positioned on the screen at the start of the game.
- **User Interaction:** Users can click and drag the blocks to rearrange them, simulating the process of navigating and connecting different topics within the field. The goal is to mentally and visually organize these topics, much like how one would approach learning in bioinformatics.
- **Customization:** The puzzle is designed to be easily customizable, allowing you to modify or expand the topics based on your learning or teaching needs.

## Inspiration

This puzzle draws inspiration from the PATOG Wiki Roadmap, which provides a structured path from foundational concepts to advanced topics in the field. The roadmap is analogous to a giant puzzle—comprehensive and multi-faceted, where learners can start anywhere and gradually piece together their understanding of the discipline. This puzzle game mirrors that concept, offering a hands-on way to explore and organize bioinformatics knowledge.

## Potential Future Enhancements

Several enhancements could improve the experience and educational value:

1. **Snap-to-Grid Functionality:** Implement a feature where blocks snap into place on a predefined grid, aiding in the logical arrangement of topics and making the game more visually satisfying.
2. **Categorical Grouping:** Introduce a feature that allows blocks to be grouped by their category (e.g., prerequisites, main sections), with visual indicators like colors or borders to differentiate them.
3. **Save and Load Feature:** Enable users to save their progress and return to their puzzle arrangement later, allowing for longer and more complex interactions.
4. **Enhanced UI/UX:** Improve the user interface with smoother animations, clearer fonts, and interactive tutorials to guide new users.
5. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the game to handle a larger number of blocks and more detailed interactions without performance degradation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **`pygame` library**: Install it via `pip install pygame`.

### Running the Puzzle
1. Clone the repository and run the script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cellravel/patog.git
cd patog/puzzle
python puzzle.py
```
### Colab notebook will be added upon rquest.
